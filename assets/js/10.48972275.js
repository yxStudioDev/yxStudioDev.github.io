There are quite a few very time sensitive matters with this case. I'm afraid I can't wait any longer.  F: Getting those Anderson briefs has been harder than you can imagine. I have tried to contact their lawyer many times. But every time I call, His secretary says he’s in a meeting or out of the office or away on business. I am beginning to think he is trying to avoid me.  M: That's highly possible. He knows if we miss our filing deadline, we don’t stand a chance to compete against them for the bid. Try to get a hold of him again. Give him a call and see if he can fax them first thing.  F: What if I can't speak to him directly?  M: Ask his secretary to fax them. It’s the same thing. Have them faxed over with a copy also faxed to Martin’s office.  F: How do I find Martin’s fax number? Is he in your roller desk?  M: No, but you can also call their office and ask the secretary to give you their fax number. I’ll email you their office number later today.  F: Ok, I'll get on it first thing.  M: Be sure you do, I need those briefs ASAP M: Did you put this morning's faxes on my desk? I’m waiting for some urgent faxes from headquarters, I'm pretty sure they came in last night.  F: Everything that came in the office fax machine last night is all on your desk, but I noticed that some of faxes came through pretty blurred, maybe you take a look at them, if the copy is unreadable, I'll call then and ask them to refax.  M: Yeah, you're going to have to call them and get them to be refax. These copies are so dark. I can't make out any of the words.  F: What about that one?  M: This one? This one is so light and I can barely read it. How can that be?  F: You know, I think the fax machine is out of toner. I can change the toner cartridge. That should solve the problem.  M: Yes, but this one will have to be refaxed as well. And look, there's about 3 pages missing. It looks like the fax machine ate half of my important faxes, and ones that made it through are so blurred or too light. They are unreadable.  F: I guess the fax machine is out of paper too. Don't worry, I'll have someone look at it this afternoon, and in the meantime, I'll have your documents refaxed to our other fax machine.")]),e._v(" "),a("h2",{attrs:{id:"网上原文翻译"}},[a("a",{staticClass:"header-anchor",attrs:{href:"#网上原文翻译"}},[e._v("#")]),e._v(" 网上原文翻译")]),e._v(" "),a("p",[e._v("明天早上之前你能把安德森律师事务所律师的简报放在我桌上吗。这个案子有很多时间敏感的问题。恐怕我不能再等了。")]),e._v(" "),a("h2",{attrs:{id:"quite-a-few"}},[a("a",{staticClass:"header-anchor",attrs:{href:"#quite-a-few"}},[e._v("#")]),e._v(" quite a few")]),e._v(" "),a("p",[e._v("【腾讯文档】en_T01_001_001_001_quite-a-few\n"),a("a",{attrs:{href:"https://docs.qq.com/doc/DUEdkQU1yV1pmWk5Z",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"}},[e._v("https://docs.qq.com/doc/DUEdkQU1yV1pmWk5Z"),a("OutboundLink")],1)]),e._v(" "),a("h2",{attrs:{id:"in-the-longer"}},[a("a",{staticClass:"header-anchor",attrs:{href:"#in-the-longer"}},[e._v("#")]),e._v(" in the longer")]),e._v(" "),a("p",[e._v("【腾讯文档】en_T01_001_001_001_in-the-longer\n"),a("a",{attrs:{href:"https://docs.qq.com/doc/DUHZ6WkxLRHdtc3dK",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"}},[e._v("https://docs.qq.com/doc/DUHZ6WkxLRHdtc3dK"),a("OutboundLink")],1)])])}),[],!1,null,null,null);t.default=r.exports}}]);
